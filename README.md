# Android Project Technical Documentation

## Introduction
### Project Overview
This project is an Android application designed to [brief description of the project goals and features]. It leverages modern Android development practices to ensure a robust and scalable architecture.

### Tech Stack
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used.
- **Android SDK**: The software development kit used for building Android applications.
- **[Other technologies/libraries]**: Hilt, Ktor and ....

## Architecture
### Clean Architecture
Our project follows the principles of Clean Architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.

#### Overview
Clean Architecture divides the project into distinct layers:
- **Presentation**: Handles UI and user interactions.
- **Domain**: Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data**: Manages data sources and repositories.

#### UI State Management
We use a combination of **MVI** (Model-View-Intent) and **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns for managing UI state. This helps in keeping the UI layer decoupled from the business logic.

### Package Structure
Packages are organized by features and layers to enhance modularity and ease of maintenance.
